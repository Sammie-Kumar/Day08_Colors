    <h1>about the colors</h1>
    <p>The color palette was inspired by nature, I took a photo of different flowers in the EPS planter boxes. There are aspects of the palette which are monochromatic (greens and purples) and the pink stands as an accent color that brings both of the other two sets together.</p>
